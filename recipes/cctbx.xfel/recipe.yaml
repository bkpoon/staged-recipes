  summary: 'Open-source tools for serial crystallographic data processing'
  description: |
    cctbx.xfel is a suite of software tools designed to process
    diffraction data from serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX)
    measurements at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) or a
    synchrotron. Built on the Computational Crystallographic Toolbox
    (cctbx), the same toolbox on which Phenix, DIALS, LABELIT, and
    post-refinement and merging program, PRIME are built, it enables
    the user to solve difficult problems relating to processing serial
    crystallographic data. The programs and modules provided by
    cctbx.xfel can reduce a large set of still diffraction images
    recorded at Stanfordâ€™s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), SACLA,
    the European XFEL, or a synchrotron, to a single MTZ file
    containing merged reflection intensities suitable for structure
    solution.
